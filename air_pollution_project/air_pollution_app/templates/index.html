                Importance of protecting nature </h1>

            <p style="font-size: 30px;"> Nature is one of the most important things in our lives. It is because of nature that we are able to exist. Nature is the environment surrounding us and it includes trees, plants, rivers and oceans. Nature not only helps us to survive but it also brings beauty to our surroundings. We can also utilise nature to make our lives easier. For example, we can use the sun to create solar energy and we can use coal to create fossil fuel.
                Even though nature is important to us, people destroy it. People pollute water by releasing waste material into water bodies and by releasing toxic chemicals from factories into the atmosphere. As the world population increases, the usage of water also increases. We must protect the water resources for our future generations.
                Destroying mountain land is also another way of destroying nature. This destroys not only the soil but trees too. Landslides are also caused by destroying mountains. Global warming is also caused by environmental pollution. In order to protect nature, we must reduce cutting down trees. If we cut a tree, we must plant a new one in its place. So my friends let’s learn to love nature and protect it.
